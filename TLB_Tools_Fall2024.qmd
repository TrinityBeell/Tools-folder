Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

My research is on Influenza A zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission. One of the most groundbreaking papers in the field that comes to mind is:

Smith, W., Andrewes, C. H., & Laidlaw, P. P. (1933). A virus obtained from influenza patients. *The Lancet*, *222*(5732), 66-68. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(00)78541-2

This paper documents the first time Influenza A was identified and isolated from human patients. This work proved that the disease was caused by a virus and not bacteria as previously hypothesized. This groundbreaking work paved the way for the production of vaccines, antiviral therapies, etc.

The most disruptive paper in the last 5-10 years was:

Garten, R. J., Davis, C. T., Russell, C. A., Shu, B., Lindstrom, S., Balish, A., \... & Shaw, M. W. (2009). Emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans. *Science*, *325*(5937), 197-201. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1176225

This paper was the first to document the specific triple reassortment event in influenza which led to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. At the time it was a novel strain that included, swine, avian, and human genetic components.

Despite the compelling evidence presented in Park et al. 2023, I do not feel that the nature of virology research as a whole has been less disruptive in more recent years. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an emphasis on researching viruses with zoonotic transmission potential. There is an increasing presence (and necessity) of novel technologies and paradigm-shifting work. Examples like mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for viral genome editing come to mind.
