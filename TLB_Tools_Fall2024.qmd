My research is on Influenza A zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission. One of the most groundbreaking papers in the field that comes to mind is:

Smith, W., Andrewes, C. H., & Laidlaw, P. P. (1933). A virus obtained from influenza patients. *The Lancet*, *222*(5732), 66-68. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(00)78541-2

This paper documents the first time Influenza A was identified and isolated from human patients. This work proved that the disease was caused by a virus and not bacteria as previously hypothesized. This groundbreaking work paved the way for the production of vaccines, antiviral therapies, etc.

The most disruptive paper in the last 5-10 years was:

Garten, R. J., Davis, C. T., Russell, C. A., Shu, B., Lindstrom, S., Balish, A., \... & Shaw, M. W. (2009). Emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans. *Science*, *325*(5937), 197-201. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1176225

This paper was the first to document the specific triple reassortment event in influenza which led to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. At the time it was a novel strain that included, swine, avian, and human genetic components.

Despite the compelling evidence presented in Park et al. 2023, I do not feel that the nature of virology research as a whole has been less disruptive in more recent years. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an emphasis on researching viruses with zoonotic transmission potential. There is an increasing presence (and necessity) of novel technologies and paradigm-shifting work. Examples like mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for viral genome editing come to mind.

I started my studies at Auburn about eight months ago, and I have a lot to learn. To remedy this, I try to closely follow my lab mates research activities. I am assembling a long list of assays and techniques I need to learn for my thesis project. I am slowly going to get to all of them, but at times it can feel overwhelming. I'm trying to take it a day at a time, and not try to do everything at once. The computing tools I plan to use and learn are as follows:

1.  Analysis of replication kinetics of viruses in live cells
2.  Doing melt curve analysis in qPCR for genotyping flu
3.  Using Geneious for analyzing virus sequence data
4.  Using GraphPad, PPT, etc., to make visuals and graphs
5.  Learning how to take MinION Nanopore data, run base calling, and analyze the sequence data
6.  Use analysis to take metadata from my disease surveillance surveys and turn them into concrete "risk factors" for zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission

I anticipate the last two points to be the hardest. However, I think I will encounter my biggest challenge when the two most senior student sin my lab graduate this December. They are excellent teachers and I hope I can learn as much from them as possible before they go.

When receiving reviews I might disagree with, I would prioritize staying focused on the manuscript's objectives and planning my communications carefully. I would start by evaluating the validity of the reviewers' feedback and my ideas. If uncertain, I would consult my peers or PI for additional perspectives. I feel it's important to respect the reviewers' expertise throughout the process while ensuring my ideas are accurately represented.

When responding to reviewers, I would always maintain professionalism and respect, even in a double-blind review. I believe it's essential to show that I have taken their suggestions seriously, regardless of whether I agree with them. I would have my response demonstrate that I have thoroughly considered their feedback and am open to improving the manuscript based on their input. If someone went to the trouble of reading my work, I owe them that courtesy. Especially in the context we discussed in class, where reviewers and authors, even in a double-blind review, often know the identities of each other.

The peer review process is a valuable opportunity. Whether or not I agree with every piece of feedback, engaging thoughtfully with the reviewers' comments can only help strengthen the manuscript. By remaining open-minded and professional throughout the process, I can ensure that my work benefits from the insights of others while still accurately representing my ideas. In doing so, I can ensure that the final version of my work is as polished as possible.

Predatory journals significantly impact society, especially in disseminating false information. When inaccurate data is later disproven, the public can become disillusioned with science as a whole. Some go so far as to distrust the entire medical science community, fueling a growing anti-science sentiment. Even if a study is retracted and scientists attempt to correct the error, the initial damage from publishing faulty research leaves a lasting impact. Often, people cling to claims that speak to biases or political beliefs.

One particular study had that impact on the field of virology. A study titled "The safety of COVID-19 vaccinations---We should rethink the policy" was published in 2021 in an MDPI journal called *Vaccines*. This paper falsely concluded that the COVID-19 vaccine kills two people for every three that it saves. In the period between its publication and retraction, the paper found a significant audience on social media, where it's claims spread widely. The link to the article was shared thousands of times across social media (Fichera, 2021). Conservative commentators took the eventual retraction as a manipulative attempt at concealing the "truth". It was nicknamed "The Vaccine Study You're Not Allowed To See".

As mentioned in my presentation, MDPI is frequently associated with predatory journals and unethical publishing. In this case, the consequences were significant. This highlights the importance of rigorous peer review and maintaining high standards in scientific publishing.

I am familiar with Dr. Andrews' assumption about being included as an author since the project began with her idea. However, authorship typically reflects active contributions to each paper. Given that Dr. Andrews hasn't been closely involved in the research, it may not be appropriate to list her as an author on every paper if she hasn't contributed.

That said, I would hesitate to approach her directly. If others have credited her in similar situations, I might be inclined to follow that precedent if it doesn't affect my own authorship. Including her could help maintain harmony. If it doesn't detract from my contributions, I might not mind.

However, this arguably clashes with ethical authorship standards, which emphasize that only substantial contributors should be listed. Upholding these principles is essential for research integrity, so a respectful discussion with Dr. Andrews would likely be the most professional way to resolve this.

The only consideration I give to a journal's ethics is how it directly affects me. Which sounds terrible I'll admit. If a journal has poor credibility or a reputation for inadequate peer review, I would avoid it. However, I would not concern myself with their bloated profit margins. I focus on navigating the system as it is, and fighting this battle over giant corporations is not my priority. That's not to say I don't think it is important or valuable; it's just not my fight. As I mentioned in class, I would publish in Nature or Science without second thought.

If I select a journal based on credibility, my primary goal is to avoid predatory journals. I would look for all the core vetting crieteria to weed out predatory journals: inclusion in reputable databases, isthe journal is listed in the DOAJ, transparency in publishing fees, and clear contact information and academic affiliations on the publisher's website. I would also ask my lab mates for their advice.

At the end of the day, I define an *ethical journal* as one that does not exploit scientists and does not threaten the integrity of science with predatory publishing models.

Assuming I'm in a kind and generous mood, I'd first empathize with that concern. I'd discuss how some skepticism in reviewing scientific findings is usually reasonable and vetting conclusions from other scientists can lead to a deeper understanding of the material. However, I would also emphasize that being overly skeptical without cause only to confirm existing biases is detrimental to one's understanding. This would usually be part of the discussion where they bring up an anecdotal news headline they remember from Facebook or FOX News. Regardless of the perceived validity of the claim, I'd skirt around it with some sort of general non-declarative statement. Unless it's virology or animal science, I'm unlikely informed enough to make a curated corrective argument that they'll accept.

I would redirect the conversation to discuss my main points on data integrity, the role of hypothesis, peer review, transparency, and reproducibility. I would first bring up data integrity. When research findings are based on accurate data with transparent acquisition methods, the conclusions are much more likely to hold up to scrutiny. I would also emphasize the role of a well-defined hypothesis because it guides statistical analysis and interpretation. I would finally emphasize the concepts of reproducibility and peer review. If my analysis can be repeated with the same conclusion, and others review the methods, that adds to the validity of my conclusion.

After giving it some thought, I'm struggling to develop a feasible citizen science project regarding influenza surveillance.

My first thought was a project on the self-reported prevalence and occurrence of Influenza A infections in commercial and backyard farms in the United States. It is tricky, though, since typically, these diagnostics are not done on-site, and samples are sent to a lab for PCR (to diagnose current infections from nasal swab samples) or ELISA (to identify past infections by analyzing antibodies in the blood). Additionally, farmers would not readily share this information unprompted. Inconsistencies in sample collection can muddy these results as well.

My second thought was a citizen science project that would monitor the prevalence, spread, and virulence of influenza in (human) communities. An app could collect anonymized data on symptoms, disease progression, risk factors, illness duration, complications, and potential environmental exposures. Patients would self-report if they wanted to help the cause. This idea also has challenges---the first would be participant engagement. There would probably be a need for a lot of marketing for the project to get enough data to make the study significant. Additionally, there are problems with self-reporting. The nature of the illness described would help scientists decide whether or not to classify the illness as "influenza-like" without having any of the classical diagnostic tools. If the patient describes the illness as being more severe than it actually is or progressed much faster than it did, then the data point could falsely point to influenza when it otherwise could be classified as a common cold.

In conclusion, I would not use citizen science in my projects. In my opinion, due to the nature of virological surveillance, the data assembled would have the potential to be anecdotal and borderline useless.

I would focus my guest episode on anti-vaccine sentiments and misconceptions. My research focus is virology so this feels most appropriate. I would describe why the controversy exists and dispel myths with the utmost empathy and validation of people's concerns. Oftentimes, the oppositional dynamic only fuels misconceptions and mistrust between scientists and the general public. I think approaching the issue from a place of flexibility and empathy is the only way to build trust between the two.

I'd do research first and read several papers on the main talking points and places of concern, so I could effectively explain the misconceptions and retain credibility. The main concerns are around potentially toxic ingredients in vaccines, adverse health reactions, and painfully--- concerns of vaccines causing autism. My arguments would consist of several tiered rebuttals.

First, I'd have to break down the science of the ingredients and echo their concerns. I'd explain why mercury and aluminum are used and empathize with their fears about those ingredients. It's important not to make blanket statements on safety because these substances, in large quantities, are, in fact, toxic. I'd explain then that the concentration and overall amount of these ingredients end up being one of the key factors in why it's safe to use and how the body processes and expels those substances. I'd have to carefully go into enough detail to be credible, but not too much that it is not digestable by the general public.

In regards to vaccines causing autism, I would have to delve into many topics. Despite how angry and frustrated the issue makes me feel, I would appear to be open-minded and flexible. I'd first cover publishing practices, peer review, predatory journals, the retraction process, why papers are retracted, and what that means. It sounds like a lot, but the issue is not well understood without the background information. Naturally, this would conclude with debunking the Wakefield study. Additionally, I'd bring up other debunked papers that a skeptical audience might more readily accept to strengthen the argument. I'd mention papers that overestimated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, and I would underline the truths of efficacy and how these papers are misrepresentations, but explain why they do not make the vaccine worthless. I also acknowledge the bias of pharmaceutical companies publishing their studies on their own vaccines. I'd end by opening the floor to the host to probe for any questions and ensure my explanation left no gaps.

In conclusion, it is a multifaceted issue that needs a broad approach. To approach the situation with any venom is to lose the argument, credibility, and your audience. When given a platform to address such concerns, it's imperative to prioritize effective conversation instead of character assassinations, insults, or outward frustration. It is both unkind and irresponsible to treat a misinformed public like they lack intelligence or are otherwise the enemy. In order to rebuild trust in science, we need to be empathetic, and above all, we need to listen.
