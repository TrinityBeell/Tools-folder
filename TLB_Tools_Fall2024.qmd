Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

My research is on Influenza A zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission. One of the most groundbreaking papers in the field that comes to mind is:

Smith, W., Andrewes, C. H., & Laidlaw, P. P. (1933). A virus obtained from influenza patients. *The Lancet*, *222*(5732), 66-68. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(00)78541-2

This paper documents the first time Influenza A was identified and isolated from human patients. This work proved that the disease was caused by a virus and not bacteria as previously hypothesized. This groundbreaking work paved the way for the production of vaccines, antiviral therapies, etc.

The most disruptive paper in the last 5-10 years was:

Garten, R. J., Davis, C. T., Russell, C. A., Shu, B., Lindstrom, S., Balish, A., \... & Shaw, M. W. (2009). Emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans. *Science*, *325*(5937), 197-201. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1176225

This paper was the first to document the specific triple reassortment event in influenza which led to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. At the time it was a novel strain that included, swine, avian, and human genetic components.

Despite the compelling evidence presented in Park et al. 2023, I do not feel that the nature of virology research as a whole has been less disruptive in more recent years. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an emphasis on researching viruses with zoonotic transmission potential. There is an increasing presence (and necessity) of novel technologies and paradigm-shifting work. Examples like mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for viral genome editing come to mind.

I started my studies at Auburn about eight months ago, and I have a lot to learn. To remedy this, I try to closely follow my lab mates research activities. I am assembling a long list of assays and techniques I need to learn for my thesis project. I am slowly going to get to all of them, but at times it can feel overwhelming. I'm trying to take it a day at a time, and not try to do everything at once. The computing tools I plan to use and learn are as follows:

1.  Analysis of replication kinetics of viruses in live cells
2.  Doing melt curve analysis in qPCR for genotyping flu
3.  Using Geneious for analyzing virus sequence data
4.  Using GraphPad, PPT, etc., to make visuals and graphs
5.  Learning how to take MinION Nanopore data, run base calling, and analyze the sequence data
6.  Use analysis to take metadata from my disease surveillance surveys and turn them into concrete "risk factors" for zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission

I anticipate the last two points to be the hardest. However, I think I will encounter my biggest challenge when the two most senior student sin my lab graduate this December. They are excellent teachers and I hope I can learn as much from them as possible before they go.

When receiving reviews I might disagree with, I would prioritize staying focused on the manuscript's objectives and planning my communications carefully. I would start by evaluating the validity of the reviewers' feedback and my ideas. If uncertain, I would consult my peers or PI for additional perspectives. I feel it's important to respect the reviewers' expertise throughout the process while ensuring my ideas are accurately represented.

When responding to reviewers, I would always maintain professionalism and respect, even in a double-blind review. I believe it's essential to show that I have taken their suggestions seriously, regardless of whether I agree with them. I would have my response demonstrate that I have thoroughly considered their feedback and am open to improving the manuscript based on their input. If someone went to the trouble of reading my work, I owe them that courtesy. Especially in the context we discussed in class, where reviewers and authors, even in a double-blind review, often know the identities of each other.

The peer review process is a valuable opportunity. Whether or not I agree with every piece of feedback, engaging thoughtfully with the reviewers' comments can only help strengthen the manuscript. By remaining open-minded and professional throughout the process, I can ensure that my work benefits from the insights of others while still accurately representing my ideas. In doing so, I can ensure that the final version of my work is as polished as possible.

Predatory journals significantly impact society, especially in disseminating false information. When inaccurate data is later disproven, the public can become disillusioned with science as a whole. Some go so far as to distrust the entire medical science community, fueling a growing anti-science sentiment. Even if a study is retracted and scientists attempt to correct the error, the initial damage from publishing faulty research leaves a lasting impact. Often, people cling to claims that speak to biases or political beliefs.

One particular study had that impact on the field of virology. A study titled "The safety of COVID-19 vaccinations---We should rethink the policy" was published in 2021 in an MDPI journal called *Vaccines*. This paper falsely concluded that the COVID-19 vaccine kills two people for every three that it saves. In the period between its publication and retraction, the paper found a significant audience on social media, where it's claims spread widely. The link to the article was shared thousands of times across social media (Fichera, 2021). Conservative commentators took the eventual retraction as a manipulative attempt at concealing the "truth". It was nicknamed "The Vaccine Study You're Not Allowed To See".

As mentioned in my presentation, MDPI is frequently associated with predatory journals and unethical publishing. In this case, the consequences were significant. This highlights the importance of rigorous peer review and maintaining high standards in scientific publishing.

I am familiar with Dr. Andrews' assumption about being included as an author since the project began with her idea. However, authorship typically reflects active contributions to each paper. Given that Dr. Andrews hasn't been closely involved in the research, it may not be appropriate to list her as an author on every paper if she hasn't contributed.

That said, I would hesitate to approach her directly. If others have credited her in similar situations, I might be inclined to follow that precedent if it doesn't affect my own authorship. Including her could help maintain harmony. If it doesn't detract from my contributions, I might not mind.

However, this arguably clashes with ethical authorship standards, which emphasize that only substantial contributors should be listed. Upholding these principles is essential for research integrity, so a respectful discussion with Dr. Andrews would likely be the most professional way to resolve this.
